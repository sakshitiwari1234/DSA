// Stack is a linear data structure
// inseetion is called push.///
// deletion is called as pop.

// stack operations-- isempty();

                //   push(); insertion is called as push.
                //   pop(): 
                //   peek(): returns the top item.
                //   size(): returns the size of stack.

// two conditions - underflow -  if the stack is empty and pop fucntion is called - it is the ccosntion of underflow.

// 2. overflow - when the push function is called on full stack and there is space for insertion of new one it is called as overflow condition.

// Array implementation in stack.
